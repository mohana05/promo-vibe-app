# PromoVibe — Privacy Policy

Effective date: November 16, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how PromoVibe (“we”, “us”, “our”, or the “App”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information when you use our iOS application. By using PromoVibe, you agree to the practices described here.

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.

## 1) Summary (Plain Language)
- We only collect what we need to help you create, manage, and schedule promotional content.
- We use OAuth to connect to social platforms; we do not store your social media passwords.
- Content you create is stored locally on your device and, if enabled, synced/posted through the platforms you authorize.
- We do not sell your personal data.
- You can disconnect platforms at any time and request deletion of your data we control.

## 2) What Information We Collect
The types of information we collect depend on how you use the App:

- Personal identifiers you provide (e.g., name, handle/username) when connecting social accounts via OAuth.
- Social platform tokens/credentials (OAuth access tokens and related metadata) needed to post content on your behalf. We never see nor store your actual platform password.
- Content you create in the App (e.g., campaign names, captions, scripts, media references).
- Usage data (e.g., feature interactions, error logs, and diagnostic information) to improve stability and performance.
- Device information (e.g., device model, OS version, app version) for troubleshooting and compatibility.

## 3) How We Collect Information
- Directly from you when you create content or connect social accounts.
- Via social platforms through OAuth after you explicitly grant permission.
- Automatically through in-app diagnostics and crash/analytics tools, if enabled.

## 4) How We Use Information
We use your information to:
- Enable creation, organization, and scheduling of campaigns and posts.
- Connect to social platforms you authorize and post content on your behalf.
- Provide customer support and respond to inquiries.
- Maintain, improve, and secure the App (e.g., debugging, preventing misuse).
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 5) On‑Device Storage and Caching
- Drafts, generated content, and cached data may be stored on your device for performance and offline access.
- OAuth tokens may be securely stored on-device (e.g., in Keychain) and refreshed as needed to maintain your authorized sessions.

## 6) Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited information:
- With social platforms you choose to connect, strictly as needed to publish or manage content (subject to each platform’s own policies).
- With service providers that support app functionality (e.g., analytics, crash reporting), bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations.
- For legal reasons: to comply with applicable law, legal process, or respond to lawful requests; to protect the rights, safety, or property of users and the App.

## 7) Third‑Party Services
Using social platform integrations (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn) means their privacy policies also apply. Please review each platform’s privacy policy for details on how they process your information.

If we use analytics, diagnostics, or error reporting tools (e.g., Apple/third‑party crash analytics), those providers may receive pseudonymized usage and device information to help us improve reliability.

## 8) Data Retention
- We retain data for as long as necessary to provide the App’s features, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
- You can remove local content at any time by deleting drafts/campaigns or uninstalling the App.
- Revoking OAuth access on the respective social platform will invalidate further posting on your behalf.

## 9) Data Security
We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including secure on‑device storage for sensitive tokens (e.g., Keychain) and transport encryption (HTTPS/TLS). No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 10) Your Rights and Choices
- Disconnect social accounts at any time from within the App or via the platform’s security settings.
- Request deletion of data we control by contacting us.
- Access, correct, or update your information where applicable.
- Disable analytics/diagnostics if provided by the App settings or your device OS settings.

Depending on your region (e.g., EU/EEA, UK, California), you may have additional rights regarding your personal data, such as the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection. We will honor these rights in accordance with applicable law.

## 11) Children’s Privacy
PromoVibe is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## 12) International Transfers
Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information to countries which may have different data protection rules than your country. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.

## 13) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you within the App or by other appropriate means. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
